jsonp us a small JSON library written in C, which includes a parser, an editor
and a serializer. It comes with many test files used to check its conformance
with ECMA-404 (or RFC 8259).

The interfaces are described in jsonparse.h, jsonvalue.h, jsonedit.h and
jsonserial.h in the src directory. The generated libray is libjsonlib.a - see
CMakeLists.txt for how to make the library.

The conformance test suite comes from Nicolas Seriot (see README.md and LICENSE
files in directories test/test_parsing and test/test_transform) altough all
tests are run directly through a small test driver runtime (conform).

Run cmake . in the top level directory to generate Makefile and just type make
to generate all targets.

Known limitations:

 - objects by default do not allow duplicate keys: any subsequent definition is
   ignored. Altough possible in JSON, taking in account multiple definitions is
   not compatible with the associative array usage and it is not usually
   supported in any useful application. It can be allowed by compiling with
   -D_DUPLICATE_OBJECT_KEYS, which removes support for the API
   json_search_for_object_member_by_name (only json_iterate_object_member is
   available in this case).
